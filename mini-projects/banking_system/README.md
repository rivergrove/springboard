## Banking System

### Description
The project creates a simple banking system that is run in the python interpreter. I explored several classes including customers, bank accounts, employees, loans, credit cards, banking menu, etc. However, only some of these were used in the project in order to limit the scope. The system allows a user to create savingsaccounts, view their balance, deposit cash, and withdraw cash. Logs are stored in the logs folder.
